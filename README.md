# Ludo Python Game

Welcome to the Ludo Python Game! This is a simple implementation of the classic board game Ludo using Python and Pygame.

## How to Play

##Controls
To Roll the die -- Left Ctrl
To click on seed -- right mouse button
To move the seed/capture Opponents -- left mouse button


### Objective

The objective of the game is to move all your tokens from the starting area to the center of the board. The first player to get all their tokens to the center is the winner, a player can also take his/her opponent(s) back to their starting position,by landing on the opponents seed,and the players seed will go out of the game.

### Rules

1. Players take turns to roll a die and move their tokens around the board.

2. Tokens move around the board in a clockwise direction. Each player has their starting area and a path leading to the center.

3. To start, a player must roll a six. If a six is rolled, the player can move one of their tokens out of the starting area and onto the board. After that, the player can roll the die and move the token according to the number rolled.

4. If a player rolls a six, they get an additional turn.

5. Players can capture opponents' tokens by landing on the same space. The captured token is sent back to the starting area.

6. Players can also capture opponents' tokens by landing on a space where their opponent's token is, sending the opponent's token back to the starting area.

7. Players must roll the exact number to land on the center space. If a player rolls a number that would move the token beyond the center, the token must be moved in and then out in subsequent turns.

8. The first player to move all their tokens to the center wins the game.
